The system architecture is designed in a layered and modular manner, ensuring reliable monitoring, processing, and alert generation for food spoilage detection.

 1. Sensing Layer

This layer is responsible for data acquisition from the food environment.

Gas sensors (MQ series) are used to detect harmful gases such as ammonia and methane released during food decomposition.

Temperature and humidity sensors (DHT11/DHT22) monitor environmental conditions that directly affect food freshness and spoilage rate.

Sensors continuously collect real-time data from the storage area where food is placed.

 2. Processing & Control Layer

The Raspberry Pi acts as the central controller and processing unit of the system.

Sensor data is read through GPIO pins and processed using Python programs.

The collected values are compared against predefined threshold limits to determine whether the food is fresh, at risk, or spoiled.

Decision logic is implemented to ensure accurate classification and minimize false alerts.

 3. Data Analysis Layer

Real-time sensor readings are analyzed to identify abnormal patterns.

Combined analysis of gas concentration and environmental parameters improves detection accuracy.

This layer can be extended to include machine learning models for predictive spoilage detection in future upgrades.

 4. Alert & Notification Layer

When spoilage is detected, the system triggers local alerts using buzzers or LEDs for immediate attention.

Alerts help users take quick action such as discarding or relocating food items.

This ensures food safety and reduces health risks.

 5. Communication & IoT Layer

The Raspberry Pi’s built-in Wi-Fi module enables IoT connectivity.

Sensor data and spoilage status can be transmitted to a cloud platform or web dashboard.

Users can remotely monitor food conditions and receive notifications via mobile or web applications.

 6. User Interface Layer

Data visualization can be provided through a web dashboard or mobile app.

Users can view real-time readings, spoilage status, and alert history.

This layer improves usability and makes the system suitable for homes, restaurants, and warehouses.

 7. Scalability & Future Enhancement Layer

The architecture supports easy integration of additional sensors or cameras.

AI-based spoilage prediction, cloud analytics, and mobile app notifications can be added without redesigning the entire system.

The modular design ensures scalability for large food storage environments.
